	* iotest.c: Supports Intel EM64T.

	* TO FIX: response time is not correctly measured when using
	libaio.	

2007-09-28  GODA Kazuo  <kgoda@tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

	* iotest.h: libaio.h to be included only on linux.

	* iotest.c: Supports libaio's asynchronous ios only on linux.

2007-09-27  GODA Kazuo  <kgoda@tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

	* iotest.h: Added _GNU_SOURCE for activating O_DIRECT in RHEL 4
	or later.

	* iotest.c: Maximum response time to be measured.

	* iotest.c: Supports multiple devices.

2006-06-20  GODA Kazuo  <kgoda@tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp>

	* iotest.c: Changed the meanings of "synchronous" and
	"asynchronous". So far, multilplexed IOs are called
	asynchronous, and vice versa. Here after, IOs which bypasses
	buffer cache are called synchronous, and buffered IOs are
	called asynchronous.

	* iotest.c: Bugs fixed; the definitions of IS_SINGLE and
	IS_MULTIPLE.

	* iotest.c: O_SYNC and O_DIRECT were implemented.

	* iotest.c: A constant MAX_MULTI was changed from 64 to 4096.
	(But, curreltly our Linux limits it to 1024.)

	* Drastically changed iotest. First, we introduced asynchronous
	IO operations. Second, we do no longer support sampling function
	of IO throughput. At this point, we entered a new version series
	1.20. But there might be remaining some bugs.

	* iotest.c: Changed slightly the result format.

	* iotest.c: Added -V option, which displays version infomation.

	* iotest is a small tool to measure IO performance of database
	servers. The original was made over file years ago, and many
	revisions have been done so far.
